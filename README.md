  # Regex-AWK Lab

  ## Introduction
  In this lab, You will gain practical knowledge in working with Regular Expressions and some command-based data processing tools like AWK. You will work on the given simple text file (data.txt) and use linux to process the file to answer some required queries.

  ## Lab requirements:
  * You must have linux or WSL to run the commands on the terminal
  * Learn regular expression (Regex) and finish this tutorial <a href="https://regexone.com/">here</a>
  * Gain lots of skills working with AWK from this article (until lession number 13 at least) <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/awk-command-tutorial/">here</a>
  * Try to work with AWK on this interactive tutorial <a href="https://n8ta.com/projects/awk.html">here</a>

  # Steps to start:
  1- Go to your working directory:
  
  ```bash
  cd <your working dirctory Ex. 'cd C:\docker'>
  ```
  2- create a text file (data.txt for example) and insert the data we will work on:
  
  ```bash
  nano data.txt
  ```
  Then paste the data instide this file and press "ctrl+o" then "enter" then "ctrl+x" to exit
  
  3- To view the data:
  
  ```bash
  cat data.txt
  ```

  Now you are ready to work on the quests âš¡âœ…

  ## Quests:
  a-	Print only the first and last names of all the clients (there must be a space between first and last names):
  
  It can be done in two ways: 

  ```bash
  awk '{print $1, $2}' data.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  awk '{print $1 " " $2}' data.txt
  ```

  b-	Same as above but print the names are in reverse order (last name, first name) and make sure there is a comma between last name and first name:

  It can be done like this:

  ```bash
  awk '{print $2 "," $1}' data.txt
  ```
